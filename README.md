# Scrabble_Training_Website

# Inspiration
The inpiration for this website is Will Anderson's videos on "Nigel Richards", the undisputed best Scrabble player in the world. Nigel Richards is able to play moves and insane setup plays that no one would see, and sometimes even computers cannot see it. However for us newer players, Scrabble is quite a challenging game, requiring extensive word knowledge and also great strategy, which is why I built this site.

# What it does
There are two main features:
1. A flashcard system for important word lists, such as words with "Q" but without "U", to help with learning the words required for a game of Scrabble
2. An anagram trainer where users are given a random rack and they have to find as many words as they could. 

# How it was built
It was built using python's Flask module connected to an sql database of words extracted from 2021 Collin's Dictionary for back-end and javascript for front-end.

# Challenges encountered
1. I am not very familiar with Javascript as a whole, and even with the help from AI, I would still have to fix some mistakes then and there.
2. I have not really used python to perform SQL queries before and it was quite challenging to write code to write queries for me.
3. To get the word list in the first place, I have to go the Collin's Dictionary website, download the software for it, extract the word list as pdf (due to being the most convenient option) convert it to a word document and then  write code to convert it to a text file where I can finally convert it to a database file.

# Acomplishments that I am proud of
I am proud that I manage to make a website from scratch and deploy it. I also am proud that I am able to find creative ways to overcome obstacles and get a working result. It may not have been what I aimed for initially, but I am proud nevertheless.

# What I learned
1. I learnt some basic javascript.
2. I learnt some problem solving skills to overcome the many obstacles I faced.

# What is next for the Scrabble Training Website 
I would include more fetures such as: 
1. flashcards for custom word lists
2. anagram trainer of 8-letter words and above
3. bingo trainer where users try to spot bingos
