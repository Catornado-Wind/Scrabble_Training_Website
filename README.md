# Scrabble_Training_Website

# Inspiration
The inpiration for this website is Will Anderson's videos on "Nigel Richards", the undisputed best Scrabble player in the world. Nigel Richards is able to play moves and insane setup plays that no one would see, and sometimes even computers cannot see it. However for us newer players, Scrabble is quite a challenging game, requiring extensive word knowledge and also great strategy, which is why I built this site.

# What it does
There are two main features:
1. A flashcard system for important word lists, such as words with "Q" but without "U", to help with learning the words required for a game of Scrabble
2. An anagram trainer where users are given a random rack and they have to find as many words as they could. 

# How it was built
It was built using python's Flask module connected to an sql database of words extracted from 2021 Collin's Dictionary for back-end and javascript for front-end.
